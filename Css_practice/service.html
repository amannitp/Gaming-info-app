                          <p class="service-para2">Most games today are downloaded and played locally on smartphones, gaming consoles, and PCs. Network connections support player accounts, in-game purchases, and social affordances, but the games themselves run on players’ devices. Game companies build services around top game titles, enabling them to deliver continuous updates that add new gameplay and respond to audience feedback on social streaming services. In this sense, gaming has been expanding into the cloud for some time.

                            With cloud gaming, a game lives entirely in data centers and delivery networks, eliminating the need for downloads and transforming a user’s</p>

                  </div>
                           <p class="service-para2">device into, essentially, a connected high-resolution terminal, with tangible benefits for both player and provider. To enable this shift, cloud gaming services are leveraging hyperscale cloud capabilities, global content delivery networks, and streaming media services to build the next generation of platforms for interactive, immersive, and social entertainment. Top game companies are responding by announcing partnerships with the disruptors or plans to develop their own competitive solutions.2 Many telecoms are working to determine how well their networks support the unprecedented requirements of shifting potentially billions of gamers onto streaming services.</p>
                           <p class="service-para2">But this is no simple next-generation update. Video games include some of the most complicated content yet to enter the streaming revolution, and as cloud gaming begins to scale, streaming technologies and telecom networks may find it difficult to deliver top gaming experiences on par with existing solutions. The video game industry is mature, and its success has only grown. It is unclear whether the prospect of cloud gaming offers sufficient incentive for game companies and players to radically change how they create, distribute, and consume video games. Nevertheless, many technology and telecom companies are steadily moving into media and entertainment, and even game companies are beginning to think like broadcasters.

                        </p>
                           <p class="service-para2">But will players see the value of cloud gaming as a better or more affordable solution? And which category of player will make the shift: Mobile gamers? Immersive gamers? Esports enthusiasts? nongamers? Each of these segments will likely place different requirements on the technology and the market.</p>
                           <p class="service-para2">With more than 2.5 billion gamers worldwide,3 the opportunity and the impact may be considerable.4 Cloud gaming could eliminate the need for specialized consoles while allowing gamers to play any game from almost any device; it could enable game companies to develop richer experiences supporting far more players; it could drive telecoms, internet service providers, and content delivery networks to significantly expand their capabilities while stoking demand for 5G; and it could shift the balance of power across the video game industry, placing top cloud gaming providers at the hub of the distribution pipeline.</p>
                           <p class="service-para2">Indeed, some have dubbed cloud gaming “the Netflix of video gaming.”5 This comparison may be instructive, but not for the ways many people think. Netflix introduced its streaming service in 2007 and in four years had exceeded 23 million subscribers—over 280 percent growth, mostly in streaming.6 Few at the time recognized the value of streaming, so competition was minimal, and the company found it relatively easy to license content. Neither of these conditions exists today, and streaming video games is a much bigger technical challenge than streaming video.</p>

                        <h4 id="head-4">The technology: How does it work?</h4>
                        <p class="service-para2">On the market for years, services that stream games have been slow to take off, hampered by bandwidth and latency challenges.7 Most games are purchased as hard media or are downloaded to a device—a smartphone, gaming console, or PC. When games are played locally, quality and performance can be controlled and optimized for the device: The game looks good and gameplay is adequately smooth. Additionally, online multiplayer games demand bandwidth among the players to coordinate actions: If some players fall out of sync, latency can quickly destroy the experience.</p>
                        <p class="service-para2">Cloud gaming moves content execution off the consumer’s device and into the cloud. Similar to how video streaming services deliver content, the view of the game is streamed to the player’s device via content delivery networks (CDNs) with regional points of presence near population centers. As with video, size matters: A small smartphone screen can display a good-enough game stream with considerably fewer bits than are required to render acceptably on a 55” 4K television. A larger stream consumes more bandwidth, placing greater demands on the user’s connectivity. To manage throughput, cloud streaming services must dynamically adjust to deliver the fewest number of bits needed for the best experience on a given device.</p>
                        <p class="service-para2">With streaming video—for example, a movie—the content is the same for everyone watching, and it only goes downstream to the user. With video games, players continuously influence the media shown to them and each player is seeing a different view. While video streams can buffer to overcome lag, video games usually cannot. Most are fundamentally real time.</p>
                        <h4 id="head4-background">Cloud gaming moves content execution off the consumer’s <br> device and into the cloud.</h4>
                        <p class="service-para2">With gaming in the cloud, each time a player inputs an action, the system sends it back upstream to the game engine, traversing the network along the way. The game must then update the view to reflect the action and send it back across the network to the players. This sequence must operate immediately and continuously for all players in the game, since for many games, any latency over 75 milliseconds or so can cause players and actions to fall out of sync.8 For massively multiplayer online games, with hundreds or thousands of players participating together simultaneously, the challenge is amplified.</p>
                        <p class="service-para2">As they play, more gamers are also using messaging, audio chat, and even streaming video of their gameplay, sending yet more data upstream.9 Mobile gamers may not notice such bandwidth challenges, but for immersive gamers, multiplayers, and esports enthusiasts, it might not be enough to have the cloud—they may also need greater connectivity.</p>
